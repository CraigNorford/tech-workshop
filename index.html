            <article>
                <p> 15 years ago I moved to the London after growing up in Argentina. My family came over in pursuit of a better life and its important for me to get a good education. My favourite subjects are Maths, Physics and History and when I grow up I would like to become a famous mathematician and the youngest person to win a field medal. Outside of school, I love to swim and play ping pong. I also love to cook and regularly cook for my mum and younger siblings. </p>

                        <h4>Communication</h4>
                        
                        <p>For my history class I had to give a presentation about the causes of Stalin's rise to power in the USSR and it was a great learning experience. I learn how to communicate my ideas clearly and tailor what I was saying to my audience whilst being engaging. </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Teamwork</h4>
                        <p>Last term, my class organised a bake sale to raise money for charity. We worked together to determine how responsibilities would be shared and made sure no-one felt overhwelmed or left out. It was a great learning experience and we managed to raise Â£93.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Resilience</h4>
                        <p>English has always been one of my weakest subjects since it's not my native language. I was getting D's in literature and felt really down. But after regularly asking my teacher for feedback and attending after school help sessions, I am now averaging a B and most importantly enjoying the subject more.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Positivity</h4>
                        <p>GCSE's can be quite overwheling and I've found that it's quite easy to make yourself feel anxious and stressed. I've learnt how to focus on the good and live in the moment. This is also something I've been trying to teach my classmates to do.</p>
